# SMS Reader App
This is a basic flutter app for an implementation for reading financial transaction data. This boilerplate app uses the [`sms`](https://pub.dev/packages/sms) package to read data from an Android Device.
It uses a parser and spam keywords to distinguish between spam messages and bank messages.
